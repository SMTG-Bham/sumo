These tests use the unittest framework and are not intended to be run directly.
Sample data is made available in the data/ folder; feel free to use this data
when exploring Sumo. If possible, when reporting bugs try to reproduce them
using these data files as it will make communication easier.

The tests can be run from the root directory of the project (i.e. one
level above this file) using:

  python3 -m unittest discover tests
