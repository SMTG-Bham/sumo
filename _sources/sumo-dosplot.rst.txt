sumo-dosplot
=============

``sumo-dosplot`` is a program for generating publication-ready density of states diagrams and extracting
the density of states from VASP calculations. A large number of features are provided, including
the ability to break the density of states down into the contributions from specific elements,
orbitals, and atoms.

Usage
-----

The full range of options supported by ``sumo-dosplot`` are detailed in the `Command-Line Interface`_ section,
and be can be accessed using the command::

    sumo-dosplot -h

To plot a density of states, simply run the following command in a folder containing a ``vasprun.xml`` or
``vasprun.xml.gz`` file::

    sumo-dosplot

The plot will be written to a file named ``dos.pdf``, with the raw density of states data written to a series
files. These will be named ``total_dos.dat``, with additional files named ``El_dos.dat`` where ``el`` is an
element name, for each element in the structure.

For example, if we run the command in the ``sumo/tests/data/Cs2SnI6/dos`` directory, the density of states will
look like:

.. image:: figures/dos_basic.png
   :height: 400px
   :align: center


Basic Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The program automatically looks for files in the current directory, to specify alternative files, the
``--filename`` option can be used.

The number of columns in the legend is controlled using the ``--columns`` option.

The height, and width of the graphic, along with the x-axis limits, can be controlled via the
``--width``, ``--height``, ``--xmax``, and ``--xmin`` options. For example, the plot above could be
made more appealing using the following command::

    sumo-dosplot --width 6 --height 6 --xmin -4 --xmax 6 --columns 1

.. image:: figures/dos_square.png
   :height: 400px
   :align: center

Additional gaussian broadening can be applied using the ``--gaussian`` option. The setting expects a floating
point number as the argument and controls the standard deviation of the broadening applied.


Subplots
~~~~~~~~

``sumo-dosplot`` supports plotting the total and elemental density of states on separate panels, or subplots,
using the ``--subplot`` option. For example, if we run the following command in the
``sumo/tests/data/OsO2`` folder, the output will look like::

    sumo-dosplot --subplot

.. image:: figures/dos_subplot.png
   :height: 400px
   :align: center


.. _Legend Labels:

Legend Labels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may have noticed that not all elements and their orbitals are displayed in the legend. This is because
``sumo-dosplot`` only labels states that have a significant contribution in the plotting area. By default,
a significant contribution is defined as greater than 3 % of the max total density of states. The
number of labels present in the legend can be controlled via the ``--legend-cutoff`` option, which controls
the cutoff in %, at which a label is given to an orbital.

For example, if we wish to give all orbitals a label, simply set the cutoff to ``0``
For example::

    sumo-dosplot --legend-cutoff 0

Will give a density of states that looks like:

.. image:: figures/dos_all_labels.png
   :height: 400px
   :align: center


.. _Selective Plotting of Specific Orbitals and Atoms:

Selective Plotting of Specific Orbitals and Atoms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default ``sumo-dosplot`` includes all elements, orbitals, and atoms when plotting the density of states.
However, sometimes it may be desirable to plot the density of states of only of a specific orbital,
or even specific atoms.

**Selecting Elements**

The ``--elements`` option controls which elemental orbitals are included in the plot.
The syntax for specifying which elemental orbitals to include is as follows:

- Elements are identified using their symbol from the ``POSCAR``
- Multiple elements are separated via commas.
- Specific orbitals can be chosen by adding the orbital after the element using a period as a separator.
- If no orbitals are specified but the atomic symbol is included, then all orbitals of that element will
  be plotted.

For example, to plot the Os s and d and all O orbitals, the command would be::

    sumo-dosplot --elements Os.s.d,O

**Selecting Atoms**

The ``--atoms`` option controls which atoms are included in the plot.
The syntax for specifying which atoms to include is as follows:

- Elements are identified using their symbol from the ``POSCAR``
- Multiple elements are separated via commas.
- Specific atoms can be chosen by adding the atomic index after the element using a period as a separator.
- Atomic indexes begin at 1 for each species in the structure.
- If no atoms are specified but the atomic symbol is included, then all atoms of that element will
  be plotted.

For example, to plot the second Os atom and the first two O atoms, the command would be::

    sumo-dosplot --atoms Os.2,O.1.2

**lm-Decomposed Orbitals**

By default all lm-decomposed orbitals (e.g. px, py, and pz) are summed into a single orbital contribution
(e.g. p). The ``--orbitals`` option can be used to plot the individual lm-decomposed contributions.
Please note that the structure should be correctly oriented in cartesian space if the orbitals are to have
any physical meaning. If you are unsure what this means, then you probably shouldn't use this option.

The syntax for specifying which orbitals to split into their lm contributions is as follows:

- Elements are identified using their symbol from the ``POSCAR``
- Multiple elements are separated via commas.
- Specific orbitals can be chosen by adding the orbital after the element using a period as a separator.
- If no orbitals are specified but the atomic symbol is included, then all orbitals of that element will
  be split.

For example, to split the Os d orbitals, the command would be::

    sumo-dosplot --orbitals Os.d

All the above options can be used simultaneously. For example, plot the lm-decomposed d orbitals for
the first Os atom, the following command would be used::

    sumo-dosplot --orbitals Os.d --elements Os.d --atoms Os.1 --no-total

The resulting plot looks like:

.. image:: figures/dos_specific.png
   :height: 400px
   :align: center


.. _Custom Line Colours:

Custom Line Colours
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sumo uses a config file for choosing the colours of elements and orbitals in density of states plots.
The default colours can be found in ``sumo/conf/orbital_colours.conf``. The format of this file is simple::

    [N]
    s = r
    p = #D93B2B

The element is specified in square brackets, with the orbitals and their colours listed beneath. The supported
colour identifiers include hex codes, rgb values or any other format supported by matplotlib.

To use your own custom colours, simply create your own config file in the current directory (e.g. ``my_colours.conf``) and use the ``--config`` option to read in your settings. For example::

    sumo-dosplot --config my_colours.conf

Questaal
~~~~~~~~

A typical workflow for plotting the DOS in Questaal is to first
converge a density with LMF, then run a non-self-consistent step to
output DOS files with a command such as::

  lmf ctrl.ext --dos:npts=2001:window=-1,1 --pdos --quit=rho

Setting `--pdos` defaults to mode 2, decomposing the DOS contributions
by l, m and each structure site. However, that decomposed data is
written in a binary format to *moms.ext* while *dos.ext* contains a
total-DOS. This will be overwritten in the next step, so for usage with Sumo please rename this file to "tdos.ext"::

  mv dos.ext tdos.ext

Part of Questaal, the *lmdos* program converts from *moms.ext* to a
plottable PDOS. It needs to run with the same `--dos` and `--pdos`
flags as the previous step, i.e. in this case::

  lmdos --dos:npts=2001:window=-1,1 --pdos ext

This generates a new *dos.ext* containing pdos data and replacing the
existing file if present.

To plot with Sumo, provide either file. If a single-channel file is
provided, Sumo will plot a TDOS, e.g.::
  
  sumo-dosplot --code questaal -f tdos.ext

If a multichannel PDOS file is provided, this will be interpreted as
if decomposed by site, l, and m. The *site.ext* file is read in, and
if present a file named *tdos.ext* will also be used to add the total
DOS.::
  
  sumo-dosplot --code questaal -f dos.ext

The `--elements` and `--orbitals` options may be used to specify which
channels are grouped and/or shown. Note that empty sites may be
included in the output if they have a non-negligible contribution to
the DOS. The `--elements` switch may be useful for hiding these if
desired.
